## Deep Learning Training Simulator

This web application provides a simple yet interactive simulator for deep learning training. It allows users to:

*   **Select a Model Type:** Choose from a variety of popular deep learning models, including CNN, RNN, BERT, GAN, Transformer, and ResNet.
*   **Select Hardware:**  Configure the hardware specifications, including GPU type, CPU, RAM, and storage.
*   **Adjust Training Parameters:** Set training parameters like epochs, learning rate, and batch size.
*   **Visualize Progress:** Track training progress using a progress bar and visualize training metrics like loss and accuracy.
*   **Log Training Events:** View a log of training events and errors.
*   **Toggle Dark Mode:** Switch between a light and dark theme.

### Future Plans

We have ambitious plans to expand this simulator's functionality and make it a more powerful tool for deep learning enthusiasts and learners. Here are some of the features we intend to add:

*   **Code Generation:** Allow users to generate code snippets for training their own models or fine-tuning pre-trained models, based on the selected model type, hardware, and training parameters.
*   **System Requirements Simulation:**  Provide an estimate of the hardware resources needed for successful training based on the chosen model and dataset.
*   **Collaboration:**  Enable users to collaborate on training projects and share progress, results, and insights.

### Contributing
