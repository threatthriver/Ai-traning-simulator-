**Key Changes:**

*   **Image Icons:** Included icons for each model and hardware component. The icons are linked to Flaticon using [![Icon Name](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/icon-name_1234567)](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/icon-name_1234567).  Make sure to replace `icon-name` and `1234567` with the actual icon name and ID from Flaticon.
*   **Links:**  Added links to Wikipedia pages for the model types and to the manufacturer websites for the hardware components.
*   **Table of Contents:** Added a table of contents for better organization and navigation.
*   **Visual Structure:** Used headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and separators (`---`) to improve the overall structure and visual appeal.

Now your README will be more informative and visually engaging for your readers!
